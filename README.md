## Problem
General public is unable to access them for their day-to-day requirements due to lockdown and other reasons and also daily wage 
workers, household helpers and others are not able to find jobs and work for their daily living

<a name="sol"></a>
## Our Solution

* We are building a one-stop solution for all such requirements of workers and
helpers. Our project would provide a common platform to both the customers (i.e. public) and the
workers and would act as a link between both the sides. 
* The project consists of cross-platform interface that includes an android application and a website. The
project would hire workers (like plumbers, electricians, painters and others). Hiring workers include
registering them with all their necessary details- like Aadhaar No., Address, etc. 
Now, customers can register themselves on the application with their details that would be stored in
cloud database. The application interface provides the customer to choose through various options of
workers and household helpers available in their nearby locality such as:

  * Plumbers
  * Electricians
  * Painters
  * Carpenters
  * Servicing and Repairs etc.

* On choosing one of the options, the application would provide the customer with a list of all the
workers/helpers present in their nearby locality with their contact details, like- Mobile No., Address, email etc.
